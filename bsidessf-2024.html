          <h1>My first security con: BSidesSF 2024</h1>
          <p>I've never actually been to a tech conference; I'm pretty introverted and making small talk with a bunch of strangers in a crowded room takes a lot out of me. I've had a growing interest in the world of cyber security over the past several years, but never engaged deeply with any of the disciplines. The most I was involved with "security" (which was really more privacy-focused) at work was bringing my teams' applications and databases up-to-code w.r.t. data compliance and privacy regulations like GDPR.</p>
          <p>BSidesSF seemed like a great introduction into the different disciplines of "cyber security" and an opportunity for me to potentially discover which area I may be interested in exploring for a next step in my career.</p>
          <p>I actually skipped all the talks because 1&#41; they were always full and 2&#41; I thought going to the hacking villages and doing the CTF challenges would be a better hands-on, learning experience.</p>

          <h2>CTF write-ups</h2>
          <p>While you can find all the challenges from the competition in the <a href="https://github.com/BSidesSF/ctf-2024-release/tree/main">BSides CTF 2024 github repo</a>, I'll be walking through my process for some of the problems I thought were interesting and fun to solve below. This was my first time doing a CTF, so I was going in totally blind with no expectations on what the challenges may be like.</p>
